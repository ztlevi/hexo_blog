# Building

For the build, the liquid cooler cannot fit in the top of the case with this special motherboard. I remove the front fan and put it at the top of the case. Then I install the liquid cooler up front the case.

# Installation
1. Install the MacOS in the HDD.
2. install NVMe script
3. Clone the system to your NVMe SSD.
