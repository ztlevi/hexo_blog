# _Treemap_, _HashMap_, _LinkedHashMap_ <P436>

Q: Explain the differences between _TreeMap_, _HashMap_, and _LinkedHashMap_. Provide an example of
when each one would be best.

A: The most important distinction between these classes is the time guarantees and the ordering of
the keys.

- _HashMap_ offers O(1) lookup and insertion. If you iterate through the keys, though, the ordering
  of the keys is essentially arbitrary. It is implemented by an array of linked lists.
- _TreeMap_ offers P(logN) lookup and insertion. Keys are ordered, so if you need to iterate through
  the keys in sorted order, you can. This means that keys must implement the _Comparable_ interface.
  TreeMap is implemented by a Red-Black Tree.
- _LinkedHashMap_ offers O(1) lookup and insertion. Keys are ordered by their insertion order. It is
  implemented by doubly-linked buckets.

Q: What suppose to the key ordering with the input ordering {1, -1, 0}?

A: | HashMap | LinkedHashMap | TreeMap | |--------------|---------------|------------| | any
ordering | {1, -1, 0} | {-1, 0, 1} |

Q: When might you need ordering in real life?

A:

- Suppose you were creating a mapping of names to _Person_ objects. You might want to periodically
  output the people in alphabetical order by name. A _TreeMap_ lets you do this.
- A _TreeMap_ also offers a way to, given a name, output the next 10 people. This could be useful
  for a "More" function in many applications.
- A _LinkedHashMap_ is useful whenever you need the ordering of keys to match the ordering of
  insertion. This might be useful in a caching situation, when you want to delete the oldest item.

Generally, unless there is a reason not to, you would use _HashMap_.

# Object Reflection <P437>

Q: Explain what object reflection is in Java and why it is useful?

A: Object Reflection is a feature in Java that provides a way to get reflective information about
Java classes and objects, and perform operations such as:

1. Getting information about the methods and fields present inside the class at runtime.
2. Creating a new instance of a class.
3. Getting and setting the object fields directly by getting field reference, regardless of what the
   access modifier is.

# Lambda Expression <P438>

Q: There is a class _Country_ that has methods _getContinent()_ and _getPopulation()_. Write a
function _int getPopulation(List<Country> countries, String continent)_ that computes the total
population of a given continent, given a list of all countries and the name of a continent.

A: This question really comes in two parts. First, We need to generate a list of the countries in
North America. Then, we need to compute their total population.

Without lambda expression, this is fairly straightforward to do.

```java
int getPopulation(List<Country> countries, String continent) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (Country c : countries) {
        if (c.getContinent().equals(continent)) {
            sum += c.getPopulation();
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

To implement this with lambda expression, let's break this up into multiple parts.

```java
int getPopulation(List<Country> countries, String continent) {
    /* Filter countries.*/
    Stream<Country> northAmerica = countries.stream.filter(
        country -> {return country.getContinent().equals(continent);}
    );

    /* Convert to list of populations.*/
    Stream<Integer> populations = northAmerica.map(
        c -> c.getPopulation()
    );

    /* Sum list.*/
    int population = populations.reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
    return population;
}
```

Alternatively, the following code will disregard the countries no within _continent_ according to
the sum.

```java
int getPopulation(List<Country> countries, String continent) {
    Stream<Integer> populations = countries.stream().map(
        c -> c.getPopulation().equals(continent) ? c.getPopulation() : 0
        );

    return populations.reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
}
```

# Lambda Random <P439>

Q: Using Lambda expressions, write a function _List<Integer> get RandomSubset(List<Integer> list)_
that returns a random subset of arbitrary size. All subsets (including the empty set) should be
equally likely to be chosen.

A: To implement this approach using lambda expressions, we can do the following:

```java
List<Integer> getRandomSubset(List<Integer> list) {
    Random random = new Random();
    List<integer> subset = list.stream().filter(
        k -> {return random.nextBoolean(); // Flip coin
        }).collect(Collectors.toList());
    return subset;
}
```
