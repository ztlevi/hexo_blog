# Embed web pages in your post

Recently, I found Hugo, which is another static site generator, comes with some useful [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) that allows you embed html figure, instagram, speakerdeck, youtube, twitter and so on in your post. That's a great feature for some social guys.

And of course, we can do this in hexo with some plugins.

Thanks god. I don't even play Instagram, twitter. And my youtube channel is just full with school stuff. What a boring man am I.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ So I just put other people's nice one here as examples.

## Youtube

For youtube or other video resources, you can embed videos with [hexo-tag-video](https://github.com/geekplux/hexo-tag-video). Thanks geekplux for this interesting plugin.

Very easy to install. Here is an example.
