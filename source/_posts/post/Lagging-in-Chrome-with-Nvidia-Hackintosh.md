# Introduction

For those of you love simplicity and complexity that Chrome provides, and also running a Hackintosh
with Nvidia drivers, you might notice it's super lagging when browsing or even just open your
Chrome.

> **Note**: The version I'm running: Chrome 64.0.3282.140, MacOs 10.13.3

I'm not if it's Nvidia's fault or Apple's, but it seems like they have a terrible partnership. So,
unless you try to buy a AMD GPU, I suppose you would like to disable you hardware acceleration in
Google Chrome. I feel like my Chrome has revived after all the suffer.

# Steps:

To disable hardware acceleration in Google Chrome, follow the steps below:

- Open Google Chrome.
- Click Customize and Control Google Chrome > Settings.
- Click on Show advanced settings and scroll to the System section.
- Uncheck Use hardware acceleration when available and restart Google Chrome.
